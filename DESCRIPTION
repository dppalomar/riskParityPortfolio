Package: riskParityPortfolio
Title: Design the Risk Parity Portfolio
Version: 0.1.0
Description: Computation of sparse portfolios for financial index tracking, i.e., joint
    selection of a subset of the assets that compose the index and computation 
    of their relative weights (capital allocation). The level of sparsity of the 
    portfolios, i.e., the number of selected assets, is controlled through a 
    regularization parameter. Different tracking measures are available, namely, 
    the empirical tracking error (ETE), downside risk (DR), Huber empirical 
    tracking error (HETE), and Huber downside risk (HDR). See vignette for a 
    detailed documentation and comparison, with several illustrative examples.
    The package is based on the paper:

    Financial Index Tracking," IEEE Trans. on Signal Processing, vol. 66, no. 1,
